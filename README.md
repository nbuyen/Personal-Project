# Game-Project

This is a project available on Kaggle.com, with the data could be directly downloaded from it.

The purpose of this project is to gather statistics and provide an overall assessment of the development of video games from 1977 to the middle of 2020.

The data file contains over 13,000 games which includes games ranging from 1977 to the middle of 2020.
Since being at the beginner level, I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to explore this data.
